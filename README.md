# OverFlow Programming Language

## STILL UNFINISHED: But now in a semi-working state

Originally intended to be written in assembly, but I ran into a major to minor skill issue. So now it is written in C but OverFlow-P will compile into assembly. Which will then of course be compiled into machine code. 
I do intend to write proper docs on this soon, so that way I can map out a solid plan for the language.
